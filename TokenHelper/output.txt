Order: Prototype Targeting System\nTracking Number: 1981******\nEstimated Delivery: 03/31/2057\nShipping Method: Priority\nShipping Address: Royal Drive, Bubble Station, Mars\nShipping Details:\n\nHere's that new snazzy little gizmo we've been working on for a while. I thought you might like to have a look at it in person so I went ahead and sent you one of the prototypes.\n\nNOTE: Do NOT follow its targeting recommendations. The software is still unreliable and seems to often select targets at random. Or at least it appears to be random. It has a habit of targeting non-combatants which is... a little worrying but Iâ€™m sure we'll have that fixed soon.\n
