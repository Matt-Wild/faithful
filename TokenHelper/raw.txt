Here's that new snazzy little gizmo we've been working on for a while. I thought you might like to have a look at it in person so I went ahead and sent you one of the prototypes.

NOTE: Do NOT follow its targeting recommendations. The software is still unreliable and seems to often select targets at random. Or at least it appears to be random. It has a habit of targeting non-combatants which is... a little worrying but Iâ€™m sure we'll have that fixed soon.
