[Debug Tools]
While disabled by default in the config file, we've added some optional debug features that can be used to help other mod creators.
In multiplayer, only the host can access these debugging tools.

F1	| Hold to spawn a Command Essence:
 ⮡ 1	| Common
 ⮡ 2	| Uncommon
 ⮡ 3	| Legendary
 ⮡ 4	| Planet
 ⮡ 5	| Lunar
 ⮡ 6	| Tier 1 Void
 ⮡ 7	| Tier 2 Void
 ⮡ 8	| Tier 3 Void
 ⮡ 9	| Equipment
 ⮡ -	| Lunar Equipment

Holding F1 as you press one of the listed keys will spawn the corrosponding tier of Command Essence.

F2	| Toggle Godmode

Godmode provides the following when enabled:
- Increased movement speed, attack speed and jump height.
- All damage dealt will instantly kill anything.
- All incoming damage is ignored as well as (most) instant kill abilities.
- Forced teleportation (such as falling out of bounds) will be ignored.

F3	| Toggle Debug Menu
F4	| Spawn from Debug Menu

The Debug menu has various functions that can help developers in creating and testing their own mods:
- The Stats Monitor shows the base and current stats of the host.
- The Spawn Menu let's the host spawn enemies, allies and Command Essences.
- The Stage Controls let the host skip the current stage and clear all enemies from the map.

[Addendum]
This mod is still currently in-development and lacks a lot of the content we have planned.
We've got plans for more items, survivors, enemies and stages. And maybe even some other things.
